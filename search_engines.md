# Search Engines

## What are Search Engines
Search engines are tools used to find publicly available information on the internet.  
In cybersecurity, they are mainly used for **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** and reconnaissance.

## Why They Are Important
- Collect information without directly interacting with the target
- Useful during the reconnaissance phase
- Help identify domains, IPs, services, and exposed assets

## Common Search Engines
- Google
- Bing
- DuckDuckGo

## Security-Focused Search Engines
- **Shodan** – Finds internet-connected devices and services
- **Censys** – Focuses on certificates, hosts, and services
- **ZoomEye** – Search engine for network devices and vulnerabilities

## Tools Using Search Engines
- **theHarvester** – Gathers emails, subdomains, and hosts
- **Maltego** – Visual OSINT and relationship mapping

## Common Use Cases
- Finding exposed services
- Identifying subdomains
- Discovering public information about organizations
- Supporting vulnerability assessment

## Common Errors
- Not using advanced search operators
- Relying on a single search engine
- Collecting outdated or unverified information
