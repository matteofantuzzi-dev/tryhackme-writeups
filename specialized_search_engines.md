# Specialized Search Engines

## What Are Specialized Search Engines
Specialized search engines are tools designed to search for specific types of data such as
devices, services, vulnerabilities, files, or malware, rather than general web pages.

## Why They Are Important
- Used during the reconnaissance and OSINT phases
- Help identify exposed services and misconfigurations
- Allow passive information gathering without directly interacting with targets

## Common Specialized Search Engines

### Shodan
- Searches for internet-connected devices
- Identifies open ports and running services
- Commonly used for asset discovery and exposure analysis

### Censys
- Focuses on hosts, services, and TLS certificates
- Useful for infrastructure mapping and certificate analysis

### ZoomEye
- Similar to Shodan
- Often used to find exposed services and known vulnerabilities

### VirusTotal
- Analyzes files, URLs, IPs, and domains
- Aggregates results from multiple antivirus engines

## Practical Use Cases
- Identifying exposed servers and services
- Investigating suspicious files or hashes
- Supporting malware analysis and threat intelligence
- Gathering intelligence for defensive security

## Common Errors
- Assuming results are always up to date
- Misinterpreting scan data
- Actively scanning targets instead of passive analysis
