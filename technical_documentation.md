# Technical Documentation

## Purpose
Technical documentation is a key resource in cybersecurity for understanding
systems, tools, and protocols directly from official and trusted sources.

## Why It Matters
- Provides accurate and up-to-date information
- Helps avoid misinformation from unofficial sources
- Essential for troubleshooting and investigation

## Common Sources
- Official software documentation
- Man pages (`man`, `--help`)
- RFCs (Request for Comments)
- Vendor security advisories
- CVE databases

## Practical Examples
- Using `man ss` to understand socket statistics
- Reading Microsoft documentation for `netstat` parameters
- Consulting CVE advisories for vulnerability impact

## Skills Developed
- Interpreting technical language
- Identifying relevant information quickly
- Verifying tool behavior through documentation

## Common Errors
- Relying on outdated blog posts
- Skipping official documentation
- Misinterpreting command-line parameters
