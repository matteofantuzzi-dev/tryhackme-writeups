# Web Fundamentals

## DNS in Detail
- DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names to IP addresses
- Hierarchical system: Root → TLD → Authoritative servers
- Essential for browsing, emails, and network communication

## HTTP in Detail
- HTTP is the protocol for transferring web pages
- Stateless protocol: each request is independent
- HTTPS = HTTP + encryption (TLS/SSL)
- Status codes: 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error

## Key Takeaways
- Understanding DNS and HTTP is critical for both offensive and defensive security
- Helps in web reconnaissance, traffic analysis, and debugging
